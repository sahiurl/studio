## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep, saturated teal (#008080) to give a nod to the previous styling, but updated to convey modernity and sophistication.
- Background color: Dark grayish-teal (#264d4d) to allow the primary color and content to pop.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00FFFF) for interactive elements, conveying freshness and tech-savviness.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif (same as in Fyvio), which gives a precise and contemporary look for titles and headings.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif. For the main body and interface text, balancing the design and lending readability.
- Use the same set of sleek, modern icons, that are used in the source website, following the existing Fyvio application.
- Replicate the layout patterns found on crazyDeveloperz/Frontend-fyvio
